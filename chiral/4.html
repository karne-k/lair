<I><P>In 1992 Zabrodsky et al. proposed a completely novel view of symmetry. Rejecting the classical ‘have or have not’ definition or the structure dependent measure mentioned so far, they chose to redefine symmetry as a continuous feature which can be measured with respect to <B>any</B> symmetry group or element. The method is extremely powerful and allows the direct comparison of any number of objects on a level playing field. </P>

<I><P>Zabrodsky et al</I>. argue that the ‘<I>treatment of natural phenomena in terms of &quot;either / or&quot;, when it comes to symmetry characteristic properties, may become restrictive to the extent that some of the fine details of phenomenological observations and their theoretical interpretation may be lost&quot;</I>. They suggest that replacing the classical decision barrier with a symmetry filter enriches the resulting information by allowing through a series of ‘maybes’. In contrast to previous measures which are based on, ‘How similar are these two objects?’, continuous symmetry is the only system that usefully answers ‘How much of that (ideal) symmetry exists in this object?’ <SUP>(18,19,20,22,23,24)</P></SUP></TD>

<P>The derivation of a CSM is guided by the following basic principles:</P>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>1)&#9;Non-symmetric shapes should not be treated as a perturbation of an ideal reference shape. All possible shapes should have an equal weighting in the CSM scale and perfect symmetry has no greater inherent importance than asymmetry. </P>

<P>2)&#9;Assessing symmetry should be detached from referencing to any specific shape. The measure should be with respect to symmetry elements or groups and not to shapes owning them.</P>

<P>3)&#9;It should be possible to assess the symmetry of a given object with respect to any symmetry group or element. Therefore it should be possible to calculate a complete symmetry profile for a molecule.</P></DIR>

<P>Consider a shape A outlined by a series of points;</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image53.gif" WIDTH=128 HEIGHT=24></P>
<P>Say that we are interested in measuring its symmetry relative to an undeclared symmetry element <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#101;</FONT>
. We can now define a CSM in terms of the minimum distance that its P<SUB>i</SUB> must be displaced in order that shape A acquires element <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#101;</FONT>
. In order to measure this CSM, we must know the points that define A and also the points of the nearest shape to A that has the required symmetry element. The method proposed is essentially a system for finding this nearest shape.</P>

<P>The nearest shape, and hence the value of the CSM relative to it, will change depending on the symmetry element that you choose. For example, A may be chosen to be a frozen moment in some vibrational distortion of benzene <I>[4.1.1]. </I>The nearest shapes with respect to symmetry elements <B>C<SUB>2</SUB>, C<SUB>3</SUB>, C<SUB>6</B></SUB> and <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#115;</FONT>
 are shown. Unsurprisingly the nearest <B>C<SUB>6</B></SUB> shape is an undistorted hexagon. While we could expect a hexagon to be the closest <B>C<SUB>6</B></SUB> shape to A, we must not assume it. This is because CSM must be relative to symmetry elements and not to particular shapes. In this case it is not intuitively obvious which <B>C<SUB>3</SUB> </B>(for example) shape is closest to A, however a procedure called folding/unfolding will find it automatically.</P>

</B></FONT>
<P>Every symmetry element <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#101;</FONT>
 has a symmetry operation associated with it. If an arbitrary point P<SUB>0 </SUB>repeatedly undergoes that symmetry operation, it will form a shape A’ that must have element <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#101;</FONT>
. This process is called <B>unfolding</B> and is illustrated in <I>[4.3.1]</I> where P<SUB>0</SUB> is unfolded by <B>C<SUB>3</SUB> </B>(3 x 120<SUP>o</SUP> rotations) to form a triangle. </P>

<P>The same process in reverse allows us to <B>fold</B> up an <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#101;</FONT>
<B> </B>symmetrical shape by <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#101;</FONT>
 to leave a single point. If shape A does not have symmetry element <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#101;</FONT>
, the folding procedure will leave a scattered cluster of points rather than a single one. This immediately suggests a general method for finding the closest symmetrical shape required for the CSM. The procedure for measuring the CSM of a shape A with respect to <B>C<SUB>m</B></SUB> element is as follows:</P>

<P>1)&#9;Draw A as a vertex polygon, numbered in clockwise order. This numbering is important as it records the connectivity of the vertices in the shape.</P>

<P>2)&#9;Identify the centre of mass (O<SUB>m</SUB>), generally by averaging the co-ordinates of the vertices – in the case of a molecule you might choose to take point masses into account.</P><P>3)&#9;Scale A so that the furthest distance P<SUB>i</SUB> – O<SUB>m</SUB> is one. This is done to ensure the resulting measure is scale invariant. <I>[4.3.2] (a)</P>
</I>
<P>4)&#9;Fold the points P<SUB>i</SUB> by C<SUB>m</SUB><SUP>-1</SUP> about O<SUB>m</SUB> to form a cluster of points P’<SUB>i</SUB> where P<SUB>1</SUB> maps to P’<SUB>1</SUB> etc. Note that the each rotation must be equal to <B>360 i / m</B> degrees; for a triangle under <B>C<SUB>3</B></SUB> the P<SUB>o</SUB> does not rotate, P<SUB>1</SUB> is rotated by 120<SUP>o</SUP> and P<SUB>2</SUB> by 240<SUP>o</SUP>. <I>[4.3.2] (b)</P>

<P>5)&#9;Define P’’<SUB>o</SUB> as the mean average of all the points P’<SUB>i </SUB><I>[4.3.2] (c)</P>

<P>6)&#9;Unfold by <B>C<SUB>m</B></SUB> from P’’<SUB>0</SUB> to give vertices   <IMG SRC="Image58.gif" WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=24>

<P>The shape they define is the closest <B>C<SUB>m</B></SUB> symmetry shape to A and is named A’. This also ensure the measure is rotation and translation invariant. The ordering of unfolding is important if the connectivity is to be maintained. <I>[4.3.2] (d)</P>
</I><P></P>
<P>7)&#9;The CSM is now defined as the mean square of the translation distances P<SUB>i</SUB> – P’’<SUB>i</SUB>. This term is isotropic, continuous, differentiable and ranges from 0 to 1. The measure is sometimes scaled from 0-100% for convenience.</P>

    <TD><P>In order to get the minimum value of S, this calculation should be repeated for all possible orientations of A and A’ and all possible orderings of P<SUB>i</SUB> and P’’<SUB>i</SUB> In practice, this measure is calculated by computer and the process repeated for a large number of orientations and all orders. This process is equivalent to finding the best (smallest) cluster of folded points (hence closest to symmetry).</P>

<P>This basic scheme must be adapted slightly in order for it to be completely general. Consider what happens when n<SUB>P</SUB> (the number of vertices) is greater than <B>C<SUB>m</B></SUB> – for example, if we want to measure the symmetry of benzene with respect to element <B>C<SUB>3</B></SUB>. The points are simply divided up so that there are q sets of n interlaced points to which the procedure can be applied separately. For benzene this works out as two triangles. These are then translated so that their centres of mass are over that of the original shape. Once the A’ has been found, the CSM is measured as normal. In the cases such that the number of vertices is less than m, it is possible to add in arbitrary extra vertices to allow the calculation to take place. Such a case occurs when attempting to measure cyclopentadiene symmetry relative to <B>C<SUB>6</B></SUB>.</P>

<P>A similar procedure is used for <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#115;</FONT>
 symmetry except the folding/unfolding is across a chosen reflection axis. The reflection process can only be carried out on 2 points at any one time, so a shape of P<SUB>i </SUB>points must be split up into i / 2 point pairs:</P></TD>

<P>1)&#9;Pair the vertices of the polyhedron. If A has an even number of vertices then split the shape into two equal halves whilst preserving the point ordering. Folding/unfolding is then carried out on opposite pairs – one in each half of A. For distorted benzene a possible pairing is (P<SUB>1</SUB>, P<SUB>2</SUB>) (P<SUB>0</SUB>, P<SUB>3</SUB>) (P<SUB>5</SUB>, P<SUB>4</SUB>). There are others and choice is irrelevant <I>[4.3.4]</I><B> </B> If A has an even number of vertices, then one of them (say P<SUB>0</SUB>) is duplicated and the splitting chosen so that one copy falls in each half. Similarly, any points that lie on the splitting line should be duplicated and one put in each half.</P>

<P>2)&#9;Folding/unfolding is carried out for each point pair individually. For each pair (P<SUB>0</SUB>, P<SUB>3</SUB>), the first point is relabelled P’<SUB>0</SUB> (folding by <B>E</B>) and the second is reflected across the chosen axis to P’<SUB>3</SUB> (folding by <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#115;</FONT>
). <I>[4.3.5] (a)</P>
</I>
<P>3)&#9;The points are then averaged to P’’<SUB>0</SUB> and this is duplicated and reflected back across the axis to form P’’<SUB>3 </SUB>(unfolding by <B>E, <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#115;</FONT>
</B>). These points are collected with those from the other point pairs and collectively form the closest shape to A with a reflection plane = A’. <I>[4.3.5] (b) &amp; (c)</P>

<P>Taking P<SUB>0</SUB> to be our arbitrary point in the xy plane <I>[4.4.1] (a)</I>, we then unfold by applying the symmetry elements <B>g<SUB>0</SUB>-g<SUB>5</B></SUB> in order <I>[4.4.1] (b) </I>to yield the points P<SUB>0</SUB> - P<SUB>5 </SUB><I>[4.4.1] (c)<SUB>.</I></SUB> Note that this order of the symmetry elements automatically yields the correct connections.

<P>A much more likely situation is that A is a four vertex shape. In order to fold the four vertices to a single cluster, we need to fold each point by 6 of the 24 elements but we do not know which six. It is possible to minimise the folding over all possible permutations, but a more efficient method would be preferable. In addition, the CSM requires a 4 vertex A’, not the 24 vertices produced by simple unfolding from a point.</P>

<P>We must find the correct placement of the Cartesian axis and the reflection plane that results in elements unfolding to the same co-ordinates. For example, the 24 elements of the <B>Td</B> group will unfold a correctly placed P<SUB>0</SUB> to four clusters of six overlaid points. Therefore the elements can be split into four groups, all of which will unfold P<SUB>0</SUB> to the same co-ordinates. Only one element from each group needs to be used in unfolding. This also tell us which elements each vertex in A should be folded by, in order to leave the smallest cluster.</P></TD>

<P>If our A had 8 vertices (4x2) these would be split into two sets of four and the folding/unfolding process carried out on each set separately. The closest shape A’ would then be defined by all eight resulting vertices. This approach is identical to that used in 2D. </P>

The generality of the CSM and its flexibility makes it a powerful investigative tool and recent research includes areas such as: fluxionality, concerted reaction symmetries, optical responses of distorted molecules and the analysis of other symmetry measures.<SUP>(19, 26,27)</P></SUP></TD>
