<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT, Bookman Old Style">I</FONT>'ve always wanted to do a St. George and the Dragon picture but expressing 'friendship' not battle. The picture evolved enormously during the rough stages (the dragon became female for a start and St.George turned into a woman and then back into a man again!) The final result was much more melancholy than expected (all to the good, it was getting sickeningly cute at one point!)</P></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT, Bookman Old Style">Y</FONT>ou might notice that both man and angel have lost the use of an arm, and the dragoness is a cripple, she can't fly. Their injuries bind the three togeather. Also, note the church has images of both men and dragons, they were not always at war.</P></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT, Bookman Old Style">B</FONT>y the way, a lady's favour is a medieval custom by which a knight is given a 'favour' - normally a scarf or other piece of cloth, by his lady before a battle or a tournament. It has a number of possible meanings, I'll let you decide between them..</P></B></TD>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT, Bookman Old Style">T</FONT>his was done as the sister painting to 'Favour', another world, another healer and another war. In this case I've used a wide range of different species (five in total - count them!) in particular the cat being, on whom I'd been doing some work (see <A HREF="../gallery/cats.html" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Aisle of Cats';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">Sleek</A>.) I'll admit that some of the ideas for this picture were blantently nicked from Mercedes Lackey's unparalleled '<FONT COLOR="#CECE00">Black Gryphon</FONT>' trilogy - the healer in the picture was based on Amberdrake.</P></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT, Bookman Old Style">I</FONT> think this is the first 'smooth skinned' dragon I've painted. That's mainly because the texture of scales is much easier to paint than skin, mainly because skin (or very short, fine fur, which is what I normally imagine dragon's wearing,) is very subtle and in addition, my favoured medium - acrylic - is not the best for replicating skin or other smooth surfaces. Its extremely quick drying time means it's very hard to blend and much better suited to painting texture. That dragon's skin was truely horrible to paint and took ages!</P></B></TD>

<BR>This sculpture was based on 'The Cage' (see below) and took the best part of two months to complete. It's a blend of a life sized human head with that of a tiger, although the tiger part might be a mask, hence the title.

<BR>Originally intended to be made of welded steel and based on an earlier design made of drift wood, this avian rapidly took a life of its own.
