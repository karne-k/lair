<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">Y</FONT>ou find yourself at the edge of a large open area, perhaps a huge lawn. It's set snug up to the northern cliff-wall and large geometric shapes have been sketched out with bamboo poles and string. It looks like someone's designing a garden.</B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">T</FONT>o your left, a slim black dragon is sprawled cat-like on a woven rush mat, carefully placed in the warm sun. Noticing you, he puts down the book he's reading and nods at you in a friendly manner. As you venture forward, he rises gracefully to his feet and stands silently, letting you study him...</b></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">R</FONT>ather to your
surprise, he stands upright - on two legs - although his stance suggests he
might be just as comfortable on four. Tall, he tops you by a head, maybe
a little more. The powerful flight muscles and the huge wings they
support, make his shoulders and neck seem broad and heavy,
compared to narrow hips and sleek limbs and tail.</B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">H</FONT>is skin - unscaled
- is jet black and reflects the sunlight in a way that suggests short,
velvety fur. Spines and crests decorate a narrow muzzle
and a rather equine face. His eyes are large and green-gold, slit pupiled
like a hunting cat. As you step closer, you can see he wears a large,
heart-shaped ruby at his throat, sparkling on a golden chain. He (for so he obviously
is) wears no clothing nor further decorations and seems rather amused by
your attention.</B>

nice to have visitors. Have you travelled far? If so, you`re more than welcome to rest here a while. I have more than space enough, although it's a bit rough. Better than camping out on the mountainside though, yes? </FONT></FONT></B></B>
