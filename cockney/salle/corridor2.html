The passage seems to go on for ever and eventually you just shrug and slow down to a more comfortable pace, trusting the dragon to stay in sight. Karne doesn't seem to notice this and happily carries on walking.</B></P>

Off to your left, a small, deep alcove has been cut into the passage wall. Normally hidden by a heavy tapestry, this has been pulled partly aside, letting you peer into a brightly lit chamber. This room has been painted a soft golden yellow and some sort of mural covers the far wall. A marble block supports a pair of candles, these fill the room with light and the fresh smell of bees' wax. Between the candles is a small gold vase, bearing single lily. This chamber is quiet and very peaceful - it would be a good place to rest a while. Glancing back down the tunnel - you see that <A HREF="../salle/salle.html" onMouseover="window.status='Chase after the dragon';return true" onMouseout="window.status=''">Karne</A> is all but out of sight- he doesn't seem to realise that he's lost you and he wouldn't notice if you ducked into the <A HREF="../salle/krypt.html" onMouseover="window.status='Investigate the room';return true" onMouseout="window.status=''">room</A>. Curiosity wars with conscience, as you can guess this room is almost certainly private...</B></P>
