<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT, Bookman Old Style">T</FONT>he door swings silently shut behind you and you find yourself in a large, octagonal chamber. It has been cut from the same red marble as the rest of the Gallery but here the walls are covered in shelves and mirrors. To your left is a second doorway, blocked like the one you have just passed through, by a door. Before you, two huge, bow windows look out onto the mountain side.</P></B>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT, Bookman Old Style">T</FONT>he rest of the room is a muddle of wooden tables, easels carrying unfinished paintings, stacks of paper and blank canveses. A large lithography stone burdens a table to your right, as does a number of large, glass bottles. Scattered over the rest is a confusing mixture of partly used paints, brushes, scraps of paper and clay models. The shelves that line the walls are filled with books and loose portfolios. Another table displays a variety of 'found' objects, brightly coloured crystals, bits of wood and shell and animal skulls are but the more identifiable of them. A polished, human skeleton in a wooden stand grins at you from across the room. Averting your gaze from it, you note that the view from the window is of the outside of the mountain - you have passed right through the crater wall!</P></B>
