It's built of cracked, bluish-gray stones - perhaps granite - roughly stacked one on another and is heavily overgrown. It stands in the middle of a natural clearing and the whole place has a feeling of age and slow decay. Walking round the base of the tower, you find a low arched entrance and a couple of window slits.

When they do, you can see a small circular chamber, walled and paved with stone. Your attention is attracted to a life sized mural on the far wall. It shows a dragoness lounging in a chair, behind her is an arched doorway, much like the one you've just passed through.

Climbing the tower doesn't really seem like a great idea, the cracks between the stones might give good purchase but the stones themselves are rather loose and you'd rather not injure yourself. About the only other way is to <A HREF="../gates/toptow.html" onMouseover="window.status='Fly up to the top of the tower';return true" onMouseout="window.status=''">fly</A> up - that's if you *can* of course.
