It has been built to take advantage of a series of limestone caverns that riddle the caldera wall like cracks in a cheese. Inside the Lair is opulent, even palatial both in size and decor.</B><P>

There doesn't appear to be any fixed scheme to the Lair. In some areas, the walls have been left as bare rock, stalactites and stalagmites forming opalescent curtains against the torchlight. In others, the walls are of polished marble, panelled in wood or brightly painted with murals. It's all rather confusing but perhaps dragons like it that way...</B></P>
