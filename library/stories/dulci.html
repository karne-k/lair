<DIV ALIGN="right"><P><FONT FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE=-1 COLOR="#006633"><B><I>`I regret that I have only one<BR> life to give to my country.`
<BR></I></b></FONT><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" FACE="Bookman Old Style" SIZE=-1> - Capt W. Hale</FONT></B></DIV>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘C</FONT></B>heck,’ - the shadow knight slides forward - wood on wood - to land on an ebon field. I frown and narrow my eyes. A dangerous situation and the future’s looking dire - I’m a rook down and three pawns, to boot. Worse of all - there’s my king, all out on his lonesome - I should have kept a better eye on him. 

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">I</FONT></B> sigh and with foreboding, shift his highness, a square to the right. With no hesitation, a bishop swoops forward - swift justice for the church and a fork as well. I whimper - situation even worse now - looks like my other rook’s going tails up - and then? With a sinking heart, I trace through the sequence - one, two, three - mate... drat! I let my monarch fall - deposed by the darkling rabble. A final gesture of defiance and a soft growl in my throat.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘G</FONT></B>ood game, you’re getting much better.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘N</FONT></B>ot good enough though - lost again.’ My mock-sour tone makes him grin - then reach over to tickle my nose - jerking his fingers hurriedly, as I snap at them.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘N</FONT></B>early, nearly...’ He laughs, ‘need more practice that’s all. You are getting much better. Another game? Three of five?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘S</FONT></B>o you can beat me again - I think not!’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘S</FONT></B>our puss - come one, one more game,’ he bend forward to replace the pieces - twin ranks that glare face to face across a checkered plane. I watch for a few seconds, then duck under his hand and start undoing his work. I get a startled glance for that - then a grin and he moves faster - trying to complete the lines before I can demolish them. He nearly succeeds to, ‘till I stretch myself out on the board - making it rather difficult to get at the rest of the pieces.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘G</FONT></B>et off! Hey!’ He fumbles frantically.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘N</FONT></B>o.’ Curling round - I manage to make life even more difficult for him - eventually he salvages about half the pieces - the rest I can feel under my belly - hard, rather uncomfortable lumps. Finally I shove them out - figuring they’re not much use to him, if he hasn’t got anything to put them on!

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘R</FONT></B>ight pain you are - going to get off the board?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘M</FONT></B>aybe - someday..’ I smile smugly at him, ‘can’t win now!’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘C</FONT></B>an’t I? All right - then I’ll have to improvise..’

<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#CECE00"><B>*</B></FONT></CENTER>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">A</FONT></B>ttempting to play chess on my scales proves rather <I>‘interesting’</I>. As he point out, in theory they make a fairly good checker board. Unfortunately, only the scales on my back are large enough for the pieces, which makes reaching them rather difficult - for me at least! Furthermore, I’m curved and chess pieces aren’t - which does means he spends most of his time chasing them round in small circles. My constant laughter, doesn’t exactly help either...

<P><FONT SIZE="+2" COLOR="#CECE00"><B><CENTER>*</CENTER></B></FONT>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">E</FONT></B>ventually, he gives up - throwing his arms in the air - before flopping down beside me. I grin up at him.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘G</FONT></B>ive up then?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘H</FONT></B>uh! Still two - one, though. I still win.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘R</FONT></B>ubbish - mine was the last game - heart’s blood counts.’ He chuckles softly.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘I</FONT></B>n war perhaps, lady lizardess but not in chess. Anyway you cheated.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘C</FONT></B>heated! You calling me a cheat? Horrible little man! Last time I patch you up.’ He chuckles again.
‘Yes well - can’t help what I am.’ He flexes his arm and winces, ‘thanks for that, by the way. I don’t trust the healers back at camp. They’re rather too keen at chopping things off.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘I</FONT></B>ndeed. How, erm..’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘W</FONT></B>hat?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘I</FONT></B> was wondering how you got it anyway? Didn’t looks like a blade cut.’ my voice is hesitant - delicate ground there but I have to know.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘I</FONT></B>t wasn’t,’ he hesitates, then glares at me and sighs deeply. ‘Yes, one of your compatriots as it happens - he attacked the Long Cliff batteries a couple of nights ago.’ His voice is short, clipped and uncomfortable. I shifted slightly, before asking;

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘A</FONT></B> big male - red gold?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘Y</FONT></B>es.. you, erm.. know him?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘R</FONT></B>eputation - <B>Igniarch E’tina</B>.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘I</FONT></B>gniarch - that’s the equivalent of our battlemage isn’t it?’ I nod. ‘Figures,’ He hesitates again, ‘if it helps, I didn’t actually fight him - just got in the way and didn’t get out fast enough.’ He sighs, then after a moment - ‘Did he make it back?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘N</FONT></B>ot alive.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘S</FONT></B>hit. I’m sorry - I... well... if it helps, he took out the entire battery, trashed the place. I probably shouldn’t tell you that but...’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘N</FONT></B>o defenses?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘N</FONT></B>o.. well, yes but not yet - scuttlebutt says there’s a trimarch of magi being drafted in to fill the breach,’ he shrugs, ‘better warn your people not to try anything, I suppose.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘T</FONT></B>oo late.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘W</FONT></B>hat!!’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘T</FONT></B>oo late.’ I echo his shrugs, ‘The Blue wings left several hours ago, they have spell casters too.’ I hiss, ‘this could be a mess..’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘P</FONT></B>erhaps, but I doubt it, our magi won’t be there yet - aren’t expected for a day or two yet..’ he trails off, I can see the sudden pain in his eyes, ‘It was a trap wasn’t it?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘E</FONT></B>’tina gave his life for it. Blue will take the Cliffs - I’m sorry.’ I lean over to touch him and he silently strokes my muzzle - rubbing the scale of my face. Eventually he asks.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘T</FONT></B>he Wall Fort too? The magi were to come from there.’ I nod, ‘ Arrgh - hell. How many?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘T</FONT></B>wo wings - plus the Order of the Eternal and others.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘S</FONT></B>hit, shit! They’ll take the wall with that number - easily. With the recent sickness... you knew about that as well didn’t you?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘Y</FONT></B>es.’ My eyes - sympathetic - prove to much for him. 

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘H</FONT></B>ow?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘S</FONT></B>pies - informants.. you know.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘L</FONT></B>ike me I suppose?’ his voice is very bitter but I shake my head and gently touch his hand.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘N</FONT></B>o. I don’t speak about you - or what you have told me.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘W</FONT></B>hy not?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘H</FONT></B>ave you, about me?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘N</FONT></B>o... but?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘I</FONT></B>t wouldn’t have been honorable and anyway - you trust me.’ I sigh softly, ‘I did know though - I’m sorry.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘I</FONT></B>s that why you asked me here, so I wouldn’t get killed as well?’ I nod and he squeezes my shoulder. There is a long period of silence as we watch the sky - the church roof is full of holes. I wonder if I looked carefully I might be able to see the smoke. I don’t. 

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘S</FONT></B>o what happens now?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘Y</FONT></B>ou come back with me - my people will, take you in - you’re not the first.’ I smile hopefully.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘I</FONT></B>ndeed. Become a traitor then.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘Y</FONT></B>our command will assume you died at Long Cliff, they couldn’t care less anyway. I do. There are many of you who have joined us - refugees, slaves and those who prefers our way of doing things. Who’s to know?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘I</FONT></B>’ll know.’ He sighs, ‘Bloody stupid.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘W</FONT></B>ho?’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘E</FONT></B>veryone who let the war get this far, that’s who.’ he shakes his head - ironic - ‘I suppose I’ll have to cough up any information I know.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘Y</FONT></B>ou’re just a soldier - you don’t know anything.’ He raises an eyebrow and I shrug. ‘That’s what I’ll tell them - you’ll be my ward.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘I</FONT></B>ndeed. Well, OK - if I don’t have to fight anymore - I won’t kill my own people. Enough death as it is.’

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">‘T</FONT></B>hen help us prevent it.’ Our eyes meet and he nods slowly. Then he glances about and picks up a chess piece - the black king. He holds it between us for a moment, then he gently puts it down. On its side.
