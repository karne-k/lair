<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">T</FONT></B>he
golden priestess with her procession of nervous acolytes and raucously
jubilant villagers are far gone down the mountainside. Even Sleek's
night eyes can no longer pick out their pin-prick torches, although the
smell of incense and wood smoke lingers on in the air and if she concentrates
very, very hard, she can just pick up the faint sound of bells and kettledrums
in the distance. She sighs and with a shrug tries to find a more comfortable
or less uncomfortable spot on the hard stone. At least it's quieter now,
the crackling of the poorly built summoning fire and faint forest sounds
are the only things that break the silence. She turns closer to the fire,
it's warmth is welcome against the chill night, although the smoke stings
her eyes and nose and makes her sneeze.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">A</FONT></B>s
the hours pass, the fire dies down and in malicious counterpoint a cutting
wind is born, howling down from the peaks. Swearing softly to herself,
Sleek slides off the stone and tries to find shelter in it's leeward side,
but the old sacrifice table gives little in the way of shelter and the
chain is too short to allow her much movement. She hurts like hell too.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">O</FONT></B>nce
out of the full fury of the wind, she huddles close to herself and fluffs
up her short white fur - trying without much success to ignore both the
cold and her hurts. It's better than nothing though and she finds some
comfort in the invention of cruel and unusual punishments for those who
have left her here to die.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">T</FONT></B>he
sudden bawling of the unhappy calf makes her jump and she grins humourlessly
as she remembers the other half of the villagers sacrifice. A small calf
too, they're much too tight fisted to waste good meat, even for this.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">S</FONT></B>tanding
hurts, every muscle complains and her shoulders and wrists ache from the
weight of the chain. She can't see the calf, it's overcast tonight and
the new moon is too dim to see by. The fire's completely dead. Ignoring
the wind, she stretches and learns all about pain. At least, she thinks,
the priestess had prevented it becoming more than just a ritual beating,
rape thankfully, she'd been spared. Somehow though, she doesn't think that
'her holiness' had cared much for her, only for the ceremony and her place
in it. Virgin sacrifice indeed - how many female slaves stay virgin long,
eh ? Even teachers and even if they're of a completely different species.
She sits again and lets her fingers glide across the smooth silver circlet
at her neck. A permanent feature that, all slaves wear them, it's cold
now of course but it could be so very, very, hot if you disobeyed. You
don't disobey, not after that, not if you're a slave. She shakes her head,
trying and failing to clear it of these cheerful thoughts and settles back
against the carved stonework, all senses alert, to wait.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">I</FONT></B>t's
about midnight when he arrives, walking in silence and the only warning
of his presence is the sudden cessation of the calf's crying. It's a second
or two before she realises;

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'K</FONT></B>arne, Karne is that you? damn it where are
you? Karne!' It's extremely cold and dark and staggering to her feet takes
enormous effort. His soft voice, when it comes, is behind her.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'H</FONT></B>ere, little kitten.' She spins round and losing
her balance, is caught in powerful arms. Sobbing with relief she holds
him, his warmth is a beacon against the cold, 'You all right? Are
you hurt?' It's a while before she can answer and then with a glare,

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'W</FONT></B>here the hell were you, you stupid great lizard?
I just about froze out here!'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'I</FONT></B>'m sorry, I'm sorry - I - please, are
you all right?' the concern in his voice mollifies her a little.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'N</FONT></B>othing that won't heal but where were you?
I thought you weren't coming!'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'G</FONT></B>lamours in the stone, kitten, a binding even
I can't break, I can't come here 'till the new day, not after a sacrifice.
It's a Law. I'm sorry.' At his obvious pain, she relents and lies her face
against his neck, warm and safe.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'I</FONT></B>t's okay, Karne. I'm very glad your here,
I was terrified that some over muscled, armoured freak with a heroics on
his mind would get here first !`

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'H</FONT></B>mm, well, there were a couple.'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'A</FONT></B> couple ? What?'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'A</FONT></B>rmoured freaks, skulking in the forest, I
don't think it was heroics on their mind though. Problem solved now.'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'Y</FONT></B>ou killed them!'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'N</FONT></B>ot if they can crawl to safety somewhere before
the wolves get 'em, no. Raise your arms, kitten.' Confused, she splutters
something which he ignores and he lifts her arms before his face. A claw
tip in the keyhole and some fiddling causes the heavy manacles to fall
away. Next he places a single finger at her neck, a muttered word and the
slave ring melts like ice, quicksilver droplets running though her fur.
He brushes them pattering to the ground. Her stammered thanks are answered
with a smile and a bundle pulled from his back. This yields clothes; hose,
shirt and a heavy cloak, all of which she hurriedly and gratefully slips
into. The fit is poor but the quality superb and noticing this she asks,

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'K</FONT></B>arne, where did you get these?'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'T</FONT></B>here was quite a band of outlaws living in
the forest at one point, they preyed on the trading caravans - or used
to. It was surprising the amount of stuff they'd collected over the years.
It's all piled up in my cave, part of my hoard,' he grins, 'knew it would
come in useful someday. Can you stand now?'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'Y</FONT></B>es - ouch! just, you know Karne - er
- thanks, yes?'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'W</FONT></B>elcome, more than - hungry ?' he nods
at where the silent calf lay, 'I am. Won't take long to build up that fire
again. Come on.' 


<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">T</FONT></B>he
first food in four days tastes very good indeed, a little too good perhaps
and Sleek finds herself leaning sleepily against Karne's flank as he picks
at a partly cooked haunch of beef. His wings make a good wind break and
his velvet skin is pleasantly warm.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'W</FONT></B>hat you going to do now?' his voice rouses
her from a doze.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'P</FONT></B>ardon, what?' she pushes herself upright and
tries to wake up a bit. Golden eyes regard her and she sees he's thrown
away the remains of his dinner, a long serpentine tongue licks at greasy
fingers.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'W</FONT></B>hat now?' He repeats, 'Where'll you go, what'll
you do? You can stay in my lair as long as you like of course but then
what?'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'I</FONT></B>'m not sure, I'm still getting used to being
safe. And free.' She glances up at him, 'I can't go back to Greengable.
They'd kill me!'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'N</FONT></B>ot if you want their village in one piece
they won't.' His voice, harsh, shake her somewhat.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'K</FONT></B>arne, you promised me - no retribution!'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'P</FONT></B>romises become somewhat academic if the recipient
becomes dead - you're not going back.' His voice is sharp, worried. Sleek
shakes her head and runs fingers though the soft, spotted fur of her mane.
Her answer is subdued,

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'N</FONT></B>o, I won't. I'm not that stupid.' She sighs,
'In fact I don't think I'm going to stay around here any longer. I'm not
a slave anymore, thanks to you and I used to have a family back up north
- once.' She pulls herself unsteadily to her feet and looks hopefully down
at him, 'I don't suppose you can lend - well - give me some things, equipment,
more clothes - money perhaps, I'm sorry to ask but... '

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'O</FONT></B>nly ask, little one, only ask. But, you could
stay here you know, my lair's not that uncomfortable,' His voice is hopeful,
'I like having someone around - to talk to.'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'I</FONT></B> wish - you've been very kind to me but...
My family, I must find them, really I must. Although - you could come with
me if you like,' Her turn to be hopeful now, she liked the drake and could
use his companionship on what would be a long and difficult journey. His
answer is unexpected,

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'A</FONT></B> family ? A mate, young?'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'W</FONT></B>hat ? No, no mate Karne, parents, sisters,
a brother but no mate, never had the time!' Her laugh has a core of bitterness
but still he smiles. Then nodding slightly he rises too. Standing erect
on two feet he tops her by half a head at the most, she'd quite tall, although
his flight muscles mean his shoulders are far wider. Not for the first
time she wonders how the villagers can call him <I>'monster'</I>.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">A</FONT></B>
gentle touch on her arm, 'Looks like rain. I know a cave nearby, it's
somewhere you can rest and you need it, I think.' A smile, 'Tomorrow we'll
see about the stuff you'll need. The cave's not far, lean on me.' She does
so, putting her arm about his neck for support and slowly they make their
way together. As they pass the fire, he stoops and picks up a flame. It
dances happily in his cupped hand as they walk, lighting the path ahead.
It's not 'till they reach the shelter of the trees that he speaks again,

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'S</FONT></B>leek, you really intend to find your family?'
he sounds thoughtful.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'Y</FONT></B>es, of course, It's a very long way I know
but, well - I've always wanted to travel and you don't get to see much
culture from the wrong side of a slave wagon.'

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'I</FONT></B> can imagine, I'm wondering if I feel the
same, I've been holding this territory for years and playing the fell beast
for a bunch of villagers I detest is rapidly losing all attractions.' He
hesitates, this time to smile at her - sharp, white teeth - 'All in all,
I think, if I'm still welcome I'd rather like to tag along.' Her look of
surprise rapidly turns to delight,

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">'M</FONT></B>ore that welcome my Lord, more than welcome!'
