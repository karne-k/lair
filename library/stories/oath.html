<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">I</FONT></B>'m not really sure how to start this, it's something you should know about
me and my past...and why I hurt you as I did. Yes, I know you've forgiven
me, you understand and I thank you for that. But I still feel guilty, I
care for you so much and I should never have said what I did and...

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">W</FONT></B>here
to begin? Sixty years ago. Yes, I know how long that must seem to you but
remember how long I'll live, time seems to flow more slowly for my kind
and memories don't fade as fast. I've tried to forget of course, that's
why I left the city, leaving my Clan to spend so many years wandering these
lands, amongst other peoples, other species, anyone but the Clans. I was
trying to forget you see - trying to bury one dark memory in a dozen
lights. I thought it had worked too, I haven't thought of her in years. I
thought the pain had gone, but;

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">I</FONT></B>t's
all my fault I know, running for years, refusing to accept, how could I?
Stupid.

I wander again. I was going to tell you my story and I will, but it's
hard. Her name was <B>Yithyarne</B>,
it means <FONT COLOR="#CECE00"><B>Flarebright</B></FONT>,
very appropriate. Warm gold she was, with shades of fire-red, in the curve
of her neck, her belly, 'neath her wings, secret places. Her face, her
eyes - so beautiful and her laugh! Goddess, how much I loved her.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">W</FONT></B>e
met on Elders' night on the Old Hawk's crag, above the city, all the Clans
gathered below us. I'd seen her before of course, a beauty like that -
all the bachelors watched her, but she was a little shy see and a shaman's
get at that. So we left her alone, most of us - shy she might be but not
helpless and her name meant more than the colour of her skin.

was a watcher too. until that night. Then I found myself talking face to
face with her. I'd flown the crag to escape the crowd, she'd done the same,
coincidence, but life's built on coincidences.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">W</FONT></B>e
met often after that and winter saw us mates. My memories of that time
are so strong, so bright and happy. Beautiful times. I remember her, gentle
wings playful in the snow, laughter, she glows in my mind, full of life.
Our first Flight high amongst the cold, clinging clouds. I loved her and
avowed never to leave her side and she avowed never to leave mine.

became pregnant in our third year. Amongst my kind, none but the mother
is present at a birthing. We are an ancient people, wild at heart and certain
fires sill burn inside of us, no matter how damped by civilisation. One
such fire burns bright inside the new mother, never will she let another
near her young, not even the sire. That's the way of life. So the male
leaves before the birth and doesn't return for half a year. A long time
that, to leave and worry. Most leave the Clans completely and wander the
southern plains. Knowing you're to be a father, is quite a daunting experience,
it take time to get used to.

so I had to break my vow, for a little while, I didn't want to of course
.. that's life.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">S</FONT></B>o
- this is difficult - yes - I returned and I returned early, longing to
hold her and my new born in my arms and then they told me she was no more.

earth tremor and a land slide, a hundred hundred tons of rock
dancing down the mountainside like vengeful rabbits. A little to the left
and they would have missed, a stronger charm or cave ward might have held
and she might have lived. If.

if I'd have been but two days earlier I would have been there too. Two
days and I'd have kept my vow.

was that song you see, the one you sang last night. That song. So often
would she sing it to me, she loved that song;

<P><FONT COLOR="#CECE00"><I>
Flame up light, our fire bright, against silver
stars and velvet night...
</I></FONT>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">H</FONT></B>er song, my song. To hear it again brought back
my memories, of love, of pain. I broke my oath you see, I left her side
and I'll never see her again.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#CECE00" SIZE=+2 FACE="CloisterBlack BT,Bookman Old Style">I</FONT></B>'ve
tried to forget but you sang that song and brought back my pain and so
I hurt you. And - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry but I love her still.

I love you.
