<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>A great deal of interest in Taxol
was triggered in 1979, when scientists discovered that Taxol has a unique
mechanism for preventing the growth of cancers. It was discovered that
if a cell attempts to undergo <A HREF="ref.html#def15" TARGET="ref" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Mitosis - normal division of cells';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">mitosis</A>
in the presence of the drug, then it will fail to complete the process
and will be left in a semi-divided state. Since cancer cells divide at
a much higher rate than normal cells, they are preferentially affected.
The result is an arrest in tumour growth, as the cancer cells are unable
to complete mitosis.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>All cells are supported from within,
by a complex <I>‘scaffolding’</I> of structural <B>filaments</B>. These
filaments help to keep the cell’s shape and more importantly, to keep the
various <A HREF="ref.html#def16" TARGET="ref" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Organelles - components within a cell';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">organelles</A>
within the cell in the right place. There are three main types of filament:
<B>actin</B>, <B>microtubules </B>and <B>intermediate </B>filaments. Taxol
is concerned only with the <B>microtubules</B>.</FONT></FONT></P>

<TD ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Microtubules
are long, hollow cylinders, with an outer diameter of about <I>25 nm</I>.
They are made up of two proteins, <B>alpha-tubulin</B> and <B>beta-tubulin</B>,
which are polymerised end to end in long strands. Thirteen of these strands
are then bunched together to form the cylindrical microtubule. The filaments
tend to be long (often running half the width of the cell) and rigid, their
main purpose being to govern the location of the various cell components.
They are particularly important during the process of mitosis - where they
form the <B>mitotic spindle</B> at the centre of the cell. This spindle
then controls the movement and separation of the cell's chromosomes, in
preparation for the cell dividing into two. Anything that affects the formation
of microtubules therefor affects mitosis.</FONT></FONT></TD>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>The two tubulin proteins are roughly
spherical and there are a large number of them in the cell’s <A HREF="ref.html#def17" TARGET="ref" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Fluid within a cell';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">cytoplasm</A>.
Microtubules are <B>labile </B>- there is a continual exchange of tubulin
subunits with the cytoplasm. The microtubule is also a <B>polar </B>structure
- having a plus (fast growing) end and a minus (slow growing) end. By varying
the ease with which the tubulin subunits can join or leave the microtubule,
the cell can change the filament’s length. This lability is essential for
proper cell function.</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="ref.html#bib5" TARGET="ref" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Molecular Biology of the Cell';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">(5)</A></FONT></SUP></FONT></P>

<P><IMG SRC="colchi.gif" ALT="Colchicine structure" HEIGHT=170 WIDTH=225 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>A
number of <B>antimitotic </B>drugs act by interfering with the exchange
of tubulin subunits between the microtubules and the free tubulin pool
in the cytoplasm. One such drug is <B>colchicine</B>, which binds to the
free tubulin and prevents it’s polymerisation into microtubules. As a result
the microtubules rapidly shorten and can disappear completely. This effect
is only temporary, as the cell soon replaces the tubulin subunits but this
drug and other like it will preferentially kill any abnormally dividing
cells, e.g. cancer cells.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Taxol has a rather different mechanism.
Rather than bonding with the free tubulin, it bonds tightly with the microtubule
and stabilises it. This causes much of the free tubulin to polymerise into
microtubules. This is the reason why Taxol has the affect of arresting
the division of cells - since the mitotic spindle can’t fall apart after
it’s completed it’s task, mitosis is unable to reach completion and the
cell remains blocked by stable microtubule bundles.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Unfortunately, Taxol not only affects
cancer cells but all cells in the body with a high turnover. This includes
those of the <B>digestive </B>tract and the <B>lymphatic </B>system. However
the most serious side effect is that of <B>myelosuppression </B>- that
is, the depression of bone marrow activity and hence the body’s ability
to produce blood cells. As a result the body becomes more susceptible to
infection and may show signs of <B>anemia</B>.</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="ref.html#bib6" TARGET="ref" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='The New Taxoid - OncoLink';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">(6)</A></FONT></SUP></FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Paclitaxel is given intravenously,
as it irritates skin and mucus membranes on contact. Slightly less than
half of the patients must also take premedication (eg. <B>antihistamines</B>)
to counteract serious allergic reactions to the drug (<B>hypersensitivity</B>).
Such reactions can result in problems ranging from rashes or a mild drop
in blood pressure, to major breathing difficulties, hives and fluid build up
round the heart.</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="ref.html#bib11" TARGET="ref" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Cyberbotanica';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">(11)</A></FONT></SUP></FONT></P>
