<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Because of the taxoids' enormous importance as anticancer
drugs, there has been a great deal of interest into these compounds. I
have included some of the more interesting examples that I have come across
in journals, to give an idea of the areas in which research is being carried
out. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Both Paclitaxel and Docetaxel are only poorly soluble
in water. As a result, a number of groups have been working towards analogues
of Taxol that would be fully soluble, yet retain their biological activity.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Previous studies, have shown that the <B>C13 </B>sidechain
(including it’s <B>C2’</B> hydroxy group), is essential for maintaining
Taxol’s anticancer properties. Neither the <B>C7 </B>nor the <B>C10 </B>hydroxy
groups are as sensitive. As a result, the search for useful Taxol analogues
has been concentrated around changing the functional groups on these sites.
An example is the <B>C7</B> - <B>polyethylene glycol</B> derivative of
Taxol <I>(7-PEG Taxol),</I> which has been shown to be highly water soluble
and still maintain it’s biological effects. Other examples, are the water
soluble <B>‘Taxol-sialic acid’</B> hybrids. These are molecules consisting
of Paclitaxel linked to a <B>sialic </B>acid group, via a <B>2-[2-(2-aminoethoxy)]ethoxy
ethanol</B> linker <I>(see down)</I>. The idea of this odd looking molecule,
is that it will act as a pre-drug, being hydrolysied back to Paclitaxel
by an enzyme called <B>neuraminidase </B>once in the body. This enzyme
is particularly active on the surface of cancer cells.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This molecule has shown to have a solubility of <B>28
mg/ml</B> but only to be about a fifth as active as Paclitaxel. Full information
can be found at <B>Bioorganic & Medicinal Letters</B> <I>8 (1998) 113-116.</I>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>New Delivery Vehicles for Taxol</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A major problem with malignant tumours (particularly brain
tumours) is the inability to define the edge of the tumour and the presence
of transformed but undetected cells in the region. As a result the search
is on for some method by which tumour cells can be preferentially ‘picked
out’ and treated. A related problem, is that Paclitaxel affects both cancerous
and normal cells. This means that it’s dosage is fixed by the maximum amount
of the toxic drug, the patient can take. To make matters worse, the traditional
oil-based vehicle <B>Cremophore</B>, is also toxic. If there was some method
for delivering Paclitaxel straight to the tumour cells and only these cells,
then a higher and more effective dosage could be used.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One possible method is the use of <B>lipid coated microbubbles</B>
(LCM). These are microsized bubbles with a <A HREF="ref.html#def25" TARGET="ref" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Lipids are fats or oils';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">lipid
</A>skin, consisting of <B>cholesterol esters</B> and <B>trigycerides</B>;
and gaseous interior. These bubbles can be synthesised with diameters ranging
from <B>0.8 - 5 micrometers</B> and are stable for several months <I>in
<A HREF="ref.html#def26" TARGET="ref" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='in vitro - in glass, in vivo - in body';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">vitro</A></I>and
several hours <I>in vivo</I>. They are also nontoxic. Studies have shown
that LCM will preferentially aggregate in brain and hepatic tumours but
not in the surrounding tissue. In addition, labelling studies have shown
that the LCM are internalised into the cells. If Paclitaxel could be incorporated
into the LCM, then the targeting specificity of the bubbles would reduce
the systemic effects of the drug and remove the need for Cremophore.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Studies have shown that LCM-Taxol does have a preferential
anticancer effect and further studies are being completed. Full information
