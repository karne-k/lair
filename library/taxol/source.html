<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Paclitaxel is extracted from the bark of the <B>Pacific
yew tree</B> - (<I>Taxus Brevifolia</I>). This tree is also known as the
<B>Western </B>yew and grows in moist soils in British Columbia. Alaska,
California, Idaho, Montana, Oregon and Washington. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Like the familiar English yew, <I>Taxus Brevifolia</I>
is an evergreen and bears flat, dark green needles (2 -3 cms long) that
grow all around the stem. Rather than cones, yew trees produce bright-red
berrylike fruits called <B>arils </B>- each cupping a central seed. The
wood is hard, durable and elastic - the English yew is famous as the tree
the English <A HREF="ref.html#def18" TARGET="ref" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='English Longbow';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">longbow
</A>was crafted from. The bark is thin, scaly and dark reddish or purplish.
The tree grows slowly, taking at least a century to reach it’s adult height
of 12 meters.</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="ref.html#bib8" TARGET="ref" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='Cyberbontanica';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">(8)</A></FONT></SUP></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The arils are the only part of the tree that is edible,
being sweetish. All other parts of the tree carry poisonous <B>taxines
</B>- the seeds in particular are deadly so it’s not a good idea to eat
the arils! </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Paclitaxel can be found in lessor concentration in a number
of other yew species, such as the <B>American </B>yew (<I>T. canadiensis</I>)
and the <B>Japanese </B>yew (<I>T. cuspidata</I>). </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#000080"><FONT SIZE=+1>Drug Extraction</FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="seed.jpg" ALT="Aril and seed of the yew" HEIGHT=274 WIDTH=175 ALIGN=LEFT><FONT SIZE=+1>Extracting
the drug, proved to be a major problem, with early research being hampered
by a restricted supply. The concentration of the drug in yew bark is extremely
low (<I>about 100 ppm or 100 mg/kg</I>) and the extraction process is complex
and expensive. As clinical tests proved Paclitaxel’s effectiveness as an
anticancer drug, so demand for it increased enormously. Unfortunately an
average <B>100 </B>year old tree, yields about <B>3 kg</B> of bark and
process obviously kills the tree. In addition, the Pacific yew seldom grows
in strands but tends to grow scattered amongst other trees. As a result,
it is very difficult to harvest and while it can be cultivated, it take
a tree about a century to reach a harvestable size. To exacerbate the problem,
bark collection has to be restricted because the Pacific yew is a limited
resource (populations are in serious decline) located in old growth forests
that are the habitat of the endangered <B>spotted owl.</B></FONT><B><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="ref.html#bib7" TARGET="ref" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='NCI Factsheet - CancerNet';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">(7)</A></FONT></SUP></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As demand increased, the <B>NCI</B> along with other governmental
agencies, moved to increase the rate of harvesting and the availability
of Paclitaxel. But that was purely a short term solution. A typical course
of treatment takes about 2 grams of Paclitaxel - the equivalent of about
6 trees. The 1.3 kg of the drug needed for preclinical and early clinical
studies during the period <I>1976 - 1985</I>, required between 2000 and
15000 pounds of bark per year. <I>1991 </I>saw 1.6 million pounds of bark
harvested to produce about 130 Kg of the drug. By <I>1992</I>, better extraction
process had increased that to 230 Kg for a similar harvest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Processing the bark is complicated and time consuming.
Collection of the bark was difficult and could only be done for part of
the year, collecting and drying took several months. What followed was
a 9 to 12 month process of extraction, solvent partitions, multiple chromatography
and recrystallisation. Later formulation, packaging and quality control
took a further 3 months.</FONT><SUP><FONT SIZE=-1><A HREF="ref.html#bib1" TARGET="ref" ONMOUSEOVER="window.status='From Plants to Pills - Professor Paul Galatsis';return true" ONMOUSEOUT="window.status=' '">(1)</A>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The present demand in the US for Paclitaxel, to treat
ovarian cancer alone, exceeds 20 to 25 kg a year. With the potential use
of the drug to treat other forms of cancer, this demand can only increase.
The only solution to the problem is to find some other renewable source
of the drug, as from <B>1995 </B>bark harvesting is being phased out. </FONT></P>
