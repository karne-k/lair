dragon, karne, Karne, Karne's Lair, art, pictures,cats,stories, fiction, 

A welcome rest for weary wanderers and a place of contemplation.  Karne's Lair is open to all, dragon or not. Come, stay a while and speak to me for I grow lonely in these mountains.

The Lair is the mountain home of Karne 'th Karnica. It's a place to wander round, read a few stories and look at the art work, most of the work in the Lair is my own.

Having spent far too much time setting up the Lair - it's sort of in a working state.. ]:=8)
So now all I need is a few guests - as a result I'm poking about joining rings, appling for awards that sort of thing..

Anyway, please come to the Lair, have a look and tell me what you think.
If you feel like giving me an award after that, well I won't say no ]:=8)
