<hr><p><center><h2>Your Text, Dialectized (cockney)</h2></center><p>Suddenly the tunnel opens out and yer find yorself standin' at the base of an 'uge gorge. Some terrible upheaval in
  the past 'as literally torn the cliff in two. On yor left, it gets wider and wider 'til the sheared rock fuses wiv the
  outer wall of the bloomin' crater. To yor right, right, it rapidly narrows, boff sides of the bloomin' gorge closin' togeffer and disappearin'
  into the bloomin' darkness, init?Above, yer can make out the bleedin' top of the gorge as a ragged, black shadow against the newly
  emergin' stars. Dusk 'as fallen but after so long in the chuffin' dim tunnels, right, yor mince pies are more than able ter cope wiv the
  reduced level of light.

  Before yer, the chuffin' gorge floor is oddly smooff, right, the bleedin' reason becomin' obvious as yer step forward onto not so bad, right, dry sand.
  To yor right, right, yer can spot that the upper end of the chuffin' gorge is flooded - a dark lake banked wiv sand. Yer 'ave a look
  'round but can spot no sign of yor 'ost. Instead yer suddenly notice a large Snow Leopard lyin' on the sand next to
  the chuffin' water. It 'ave a looks up, notices yer and makes an 'over 'ere' gesture wiv its por. 

  Ravver 'esitantly yer ball of chalk over and then carefully 'unker dahn on the bleedin' sand at a safe distance. The bleedin' leopard nods at
  yer in the bleedin' chinaly manner and yer cop a strong feelin' that sumfink odd is gahn on. For some time yer boff sit
  there enjoyin' the bloomin' cool air and the gentle splashin' of the lake. The water is pitch black in this light and yer can't
  cop any idea of its depff.

  Eventually yor 'ost speaks - 'is voice is softer than before but still familiar.

  I should imagine yor wonderin' why I call this place the salle, then, mate? Well, I decided that there should be at least one
  room in the lair where I could relax certain illusions. I didn't want that place ter be too obvious - I'm bloody well workin' 'ard at
  buildin' up the feel of the bleedin' Lair and I don't want ter damage that wiv too much *reality*. That's why yer spot me as
  yer do, ravver than a 'real' me.

  The chuffin' leopard nods ter itself then chuckles softly. He turns ter 'ave a look at yer, right, the chuffin' rolls over, lollin' comfortably on the
  still warm sand.

  That and because I'd be almost as 'appy ter be a cat as a dragon. Indeed, right, Karne started out as a cat - but then yer
  might 'ave been able ter guess that. He tends ter change from time ter time - as do I, init?Any roads, right, spose I should
  introduce meself. The name is Michael Wright and I'm bloody well a 20 sumfink chemistry student at Imperial College
  London. That's in me spare time o'course!  Right! As yer 'ave seen I've an interest in fantasy and SF fiction, right, French Tutors
  generally and fantasy art. Oh yes, right, and fencin' - fough I 'aven't done any of that for a wile. I'm not gonna say
  much about the bleedin' real me since it's ravver uninterestin' and any road that's not right the point of this site. 

  So woss the chuffin' point, eh, squire? Why 'ave I built the bloomin' Lair, then, eh, squire? Part of it is for the experience, right, I build web sites as an 'obby (and
  even for brass!) and part of it is a desire ter 'mark out a territory'. Mainly fough, this place gives me somewhere to
  play, somewhere ter be uvver than wot I am. Karne is a fairly important geezer in me life (yes I know that sounds
  silly) - many blokes 'ave asked me 'do yer *right* believe yor a dragon?' Well the answer is no, ffough if I were
  offered the bleedin' chance ter be one.. [chuckle] Karne allows me a certain amount of freedom, he also lets me entertain
  meself and uvvers frough me art or fiction and frough me web presence. Hope that makes sense - if not, well..
  forget it - it's not that important after all!  Right!

  And why am I a cat atm? Well... I can't be Karne and I 'ave certain aversion ter bein' meself on the net - for them
  'oo don't understand wot I mean by that lets just say I findin' it more entertainin' ter be sumfink else [grin] As
  for photos.. well, there might be a few of me dotted 'round - spot if yer can find one. Yer can't 'ave a knees-up wivout a joanna. I'm bloody well not gonna make then
  obvious am I?

  The bloomin' cat chuckles softly and then nods a farewell. Cor blimey guv, would I lie to you? Then, as yer wotch, right, he slowly fades out - leavin' only the grin that
  last quite some time after the rest of 'im 'as gone. 

  Yer sit by the chuffin' water for a wile, right, ffinkin' ter yorself then push yorself ter yor feet and loaf of bread back ter the study. No
  doubt yer'll find Karne there - yor 'ave a lookin' forward ter talkin' ter him.<p><hr>Back to <a href="./"><em>The Dialectizer home page</em></a>.
