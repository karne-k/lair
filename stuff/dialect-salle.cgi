<hr><p><center><h2>Your Text, Dialectized (redneck)</h2></center><p>Suddenly th' tunnel opens out an' yo' find yo'seff stan'in' at th' base of a huge go'ge. Some terrible upheaval in
  th' past has literally to'n th' cliff in two. On yer lef', it gits wider an' wider 'til th' sheared rock fuses wif the
  outer wall of th' crater. To yer right, it rapidly narrows, both sides of th' go'ge closin' togither an' disappearin'
  into th' darkness. Above, yo' kin make out th' top of th' go'ge as a ragged, black shadow aginst th' nooly
  emergin' stars. Dusk has fallen but af'er so long in th' dim tunnels, yer eyes is mo'e than able t'cope wif the
  redooced level of light.

  Befo'e yo', th' go'ge flore is oddly smooth, th' reason bea-comin' obvious as yo' step fo'ward onto fine, dry san'.
  To yer right, yo' kin see thet th' upper ind of th' go'ge is flooded - a dark lake banked wif san'. Yo' look
  aroun' but kin see no sign of yer host. Instead yo' suddenly notice a large Snow Leopard lyin' on th' san' next to
  th' water. It looks up, notices yo' an' makes an 'ovah hyar' gesture wif its paw. 

  Rather hesitantly yo' walk on over an' then carefully hunker down on th' san' at a safe distance. Th' leopard nods at
  yo' in th' friendly manner an' yo' git a strong feelin' thet sumpin odd is gwine on, as enny fool kin plainly see. Fo' some time yo' both sit
  thar injoyin' th' right fine air an' th' juntle splashin' of th' lake. Th' water is pitch black in this hyar light an' yo' kin't
  git enny idea of its depph.

  Eventually yer host speaks - his voice is sof'er than befo'e but still familiar.

  ah sh'd imagine yer wonnerin' whuffo' ah call this hyar place th' salle? Wal, ah decided thet thar sh'd be at least one
  room in th' lair whar ah c'd relax sartin illushuns. ah didn't be hankerin' thet place t'be too obvious - ah's wawkin' hard at
  buildin' up th' feel of th' Lair an' ah doesn't be hankerin' t'damage thet wif too much *reality*. Thet's whuffo' yo' see me as
  yo' does, rather than a 'real' me.

  Th' leopard nods t'itse'f then chuckles sof'ly. He turns t'look atcha, th' rolls on over, lollin' comfo'tably on the
  still warm san'.

  Thet an' on account o' I'd be almost as happy t'be a houn'dog as a dragon, as enny fool kin plainly see. Indeed, Karne started out as a houn'dog - but then yo'
  might haf been able t'guess thet. He tends t'change fum time t'time - as does I. Ennyways, suppose ah sh'd
  intrydooce mahse'f. Th' name is Ichabod Wright an' ah's a 20 sumpin chemistry student at Imperial College
  London, as enny fool kin plainly see. Thet's in mah spare time of course! As yo' haf see I've an interess in fantasy an' SF fickshun, computers
  junerally an' fantasy art. Oh yessuh, an' fencin' - though ah ain't done enny of thet fo' a spell. ah's not a-gonna say
  much about th' real me on account o' it's rather uninterestin' an' ennyway thass not pow'ful th' point of this hyar site. 

  So whut is th' point? Whuffo' haf ah built th' Lair? Part of it is fo' th' experience, ah build web sites as a hobby (an'
  even fo' money!  Fry mah hide!) an' part of it is a desuhe t''mark out a territo'y'. Mainly though, this hyar place gives me somewhar to
  play, somewhar t'be other than whut ah's. Karne is a fairly impo'tant varmint in mah life (yes ah knows thet soun's
  silly) - menny varmints haf axed me 'do yo' *pow'ful* believe yer a dragon?' Wal th' answer is no, though eff'n ah was
  offered th' chance t'be one.. [chuckle] Karne allers me a sartin amount of freedom, he also lets me intertain
  mahse'f an' others through mah art o' fickshun an' through mah web presence. Hope thet makes sense - eff'n not, fine..
  fo'git it - it's not thet impo'tant af'er all!  Fry mah hide!

  An' whuffo' is ah a houn'dog atm? Wal... ah cain't be Karne an' ah have sartin avahshun t'bein' mahse'f on th' net - fo' them
  who doesn't unnerstan' whut ah mean by thet lets jest say ah findin' it mo'e intertainin' t'be sumpin else [grin] As
  fo' photos.. fine, thar might be a few of me dotted aroun' - see eff'n yo' kin find one. ah's not a-gonna make then
  obvious is I?

  Th' cat chuckles sof'ly an' then nods a farefine. Then, as yo' watch, he slowly fades out - leavin' only th' grin thet
  last quite some time af'er th' ress of him has gone. 

  Yo' set by th' water fo' a spell, reckonin' t'yo'seff then push yo'seff t'yer feet an' haid back t'th' study. No
  doubt yo'll find Karne thar - yer lookin' fo'ward t'talkin' t'him, dawgone it.<p><hr>Back to <a href="./"><em>The Dialectizer home page</em></a>.
