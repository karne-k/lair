<hr><p><center><h2>Your Text, Dialectized (cockney)</h2></center><p>The study is large and beautifully furnished in red and gold. As yer ball of chalk in, right, yer realize that this room - unlike
  many of the uvvers - 'as been carved from solid, virgin rock. The walls are panelled in dark stained oak but the
  'igh vaulted ceilin' is made of unjoined stone, intricately carved. Before yer, a couple of large French windows
  'ave a look out over the Herb Garden. Karne is waitin' for yer, drinkin' a red wine from a strangely elongated cup. He
  offers yer a glass.

  Ah, there yer are. I were wonderin' where yer'd got to. Cor blimey guv! Come in, right, come in - a drink, then, eh? Yor room's whistle and fluteable I
  'ope, then, luv? Excellent, and yor welcome. 

  So - 'ow can I 'elp yer, isit?Yer must 'ave some reason for travellin' in these parts, right, peraps seekin' some bloke or
  sumfink, eh, mate? Or are yer just curious, eh, luv? If so maybe I can 'elp. I 'ave an extensive Library and Gallery, right, boff of
  wich I'm right proud. Much of the contents is me own I'm bloody well afraid ter say, ffough I'm 'ave a lookin' ter include some
  uvver blokes's work if I can. Yor more then welcome ter visit them, o'course. 

  If it's answers ter ravver more scientific questions that yer seek, ffen yer might like ter explore me Workshop
  and Laboratory. If uvver blokes, right, ffen try the bleedin' Hall of Mirrors or the Circle of Stones - fough it's copping ravver
  dark ter be wanderin' 'round outside. All depends wotcher after right!  Blimey! 

  Alternatively, yer can just explore, there's a Fencin' Salle and a Studio out there, if yer can find them!  Honest guv! I give
  yer the chuffin' Freedom of me Lair o'course - I trust yer will respect that. <p><hr>Back to <a href="./"><em>The Dialectizer home page</em></a>.
